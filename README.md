Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic application of principles, methodology and tools of software engineering to create and maintain softwares of high quality and standards.
An importance of sofware engineering is the development of software systems and applications that seamlessly power everyday life through communication, trade, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Invention of programming languages like C and Fortran, the introduction of Sofware Engineering as a discipline, the rise of agile technologies and the advent of structured programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Sofware development life cycle includes the following phases:
Requirements which is the gathering and documenting the needs of users and system requirements.
Designing that includes making high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation that consists of writing blocks of code and building the software in accordance with the design specifications.
Testing of the software that involves conducting various tests to ensyre the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment of the software is releasing the sofware to users to meet their needs.
Maintenance involves the provision of continous support, updates and enhancements to the software after releasing it to the users.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the orderly approach with separate phases on a step by step basis flowing downwards like a waterfall while the agile methodology involves iterative and increamental basis that concentrates on flexibility, collaboration and response to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Sofware Developer writes code and actualizes software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer checks for software quality by designing and testing the softwares.
Project Manager supervises the planning, implementation and deployment of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments assist software engineers in writing, debbuging and testing code, an example is the Visual Studio. Version Control Systems on the other hand assist in tracking changes to source codes and coordinationg work among members of a team, an example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced by software engineers include:
Tight deadlines by clients. Sofware Engineers are pressured to deliver projects on a small span of time leading to hasty development with poor quality.
Channging user requirement. During the development cycle of software, some requirements may change leadin to a creeping scope and delay of projects.
Techinical debt that pile as a result of unsustainable solutions or shortcuts thus negatively affecting development efforts in the future and increasing maintenance cost.
Strategies that can be employed to overcome these challenges include:
Effective communication. This is the exchange of enough information between team members in a project and also with a client in order to avoid issues of changing requirement.
Agile methodologies. This the iterative and continous increamental approach in developing software which focuses on collaboration, flexibility and response to change thus avoiding technical debt.
Prioritization of tasks. This involves the sequantial approach of developing software in terms of handling the most important aspects first.
Continuous re-assessment of project objectives and timelines in oder to meet user needs and deadlines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual modules of a software.
Integration testing is the testing of interactions between different components of a software.
System testing involves testing a software as a whole.
Acceptance testing involves testing a software to find out whether it meets the user needs and requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the crafting of statements in order to get the best possible answers from models of Artificial Intelligence. It assists in making clear statements which are specific so that an AI model understands what is needed.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt: Recommend places to visit in Africa.
An improvement of the prompt: Recommend scenic countries to visit in Africa for a first time overseas tourist.
